Design an algorithm that would seat people more equitably.

Seats can be purchased as economy_plus or regular_economy. 

The seating alogrithm will include a method reservedSeats() that use reservation data from previous flight on each route to determine the number of rows it will hold for group or family travelers. 

Economy_plus passengers select their seats when they purchase their tickets. The seating algorithm will also block passengers from selecting specific seat assignments during booking if they were traveling alone or with just one companion. This will make it easier for families or those traveling in groups of three or more to be seated near each other in the airline's main economy cabin by reserving them a certain number of rows on each flight.
