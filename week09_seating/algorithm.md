### Write up a description of the algorithm you will implement

Families and people with accessibility needs should be seated before general economy with priority to keeping them with at least one other party member, keeping children with an adult, and keeping children and people with disabilities out of the emergency exit rows.

Parties should be kept with at least one other party member unless they specifically opt out of that prioritization.

Priority seating for handicapped. Passengers are not assigned seats. As tickets are purchased, seats are assigned from front to back. Parties/families are kept together.  Single flyers are filled in the random empty seats
